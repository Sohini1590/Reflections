Ques 1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Ans: I would like to use a remote repository when others are also working on my project so that after I make a commit my changes become visible to other developers and at the same time I can also check the contribution of others in my project. Also if I am doing a standalone project and want to share my work with others then I will user remote repository.

Ques 2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Ans: The remote repository might contain commits performed by others who are working on the same project and there will be times where I might want my local to contain only the features that I have added to the project to keep it simple and track changes performed only by me easily. Manual saving gives me the provision to pull the changes when I am ready to fetch changes performed by others to my local. It also gives me the flexibility that my code in local will not change automatically. Sometimes if the newer commits performed in the remote repository introduces a bug, I might not want to pull the changes until the bug is fixed and manual pull option gives me the provision to pull the change only when I will want it.

Ques 3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork --> GitHub allows user to copy some others repository directly on the GitHub server without pulling down the code in local machine first. It is used only in the context of GitHub. Forking is usually performed when user does not have access to modify the original GitHun repository.
Clone --> Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one exactly like it. The original repository could either be remote or local.
Branch --> Branches happen on a single repository and is performed when some experimental feature needs to be added that we currently do not want to add in the official code. Branches can be pushed or pulled.

Ques 4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Ans: When working in a collaborative project there will be times when I will perform a commit in my local and my other colleague will perform another commit in GitHub. In those cases having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored in my local gives the flexibility to merge both the commits performed by me and my colleague together. It also allows me to know the state of my local and remote repository i.e, whether my local is ahead, behind, up-to-date or out-of-sync with the remote repository. Along with this if I want to go off-line I can fetch all the changes performed in the remote repository to my local and yet not merge it.
